Like a pop-corn in your hand
Is your castle made of sand
Life goes up and life goes down
And life goes round and round and round.

Like a pop-corn bouncing high
You can reach out for the sky
You can try and you can lie
And you can fly and wonder why.

Like a pop-corn bouncing low
You can fall down in the snow
You can sigh and you can cry
And you can die till you let go.

Time... Time... Time to stay
Time... Time... come what may
Time... Time... night or day
Time... Time... Time flies away.

When the sun is shining blue
When the sun is shining blue
Take a ride and follow the tide
Until you're inside... my pop poppy-corn.

When the sun is shining grey
When the sun is shining grey
Close your eyes and you'll realise
That time only flies... my pop poppy-corn.
